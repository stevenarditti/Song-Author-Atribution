conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn\u2019t wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m no mortal man\nMaybe I\u2019m just another nigga\u201d\n\nShit and that\u2019s all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain\u2019t really a poem\nI just felt like it\u2019s something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\n\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat\u2019s how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I\u2019m saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\n\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that\u2019s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\n\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it\u2019s time to make millions for myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\n\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\n\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it\u2019s no problem, you know\nI mean, it\u2019s a problem but I\u2019m not finna let them know\nI\u2019m finna go straight through\n\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\n\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back\n\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I\u2019m fighting a war I can\u2019t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\n\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that\u2019s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it\u2019s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don\u2019t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, you can look around\nYou don\u2019t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\n\nThat\u2019s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere\u2019s nothing but turmoil goin\u2019 on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don\u2019t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it\u2019s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain\u2019t gonna be no playing\nIt\u2019s gonna be murder, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nIt\u2019s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna happen\n\nThat\u2019s crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don\u2019t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don\u2019t know what type of energy I\u2019ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it's spirits, we ain\u2019t even really rappin\u2019\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt\u2019s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac?

I\u2019m chillin' once I park this luxury car\nHopping out feeling big as Mutombo\n\"20 on pump 6,\" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo\n20 years ago, can't forget\nNow I can lend him a ear or two\nHow to stack these residuals tenfold\nThe liberal concept of what men'll do\n\"20 on 6,\" he didn't hear me\nIndigenous African only spoke Zulu\nMy American tongue was leery\nWalked out the gas station\nA homeless man with a semi-tan complexion\nAsked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land\nDeep water, powder blue skies that crack open\nA piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'\nHe begged and pleaded\nAsked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it\nTold him, \"Beat it\"\nContributin' money just for his pipe\u2014I couldn't see it\nHe said, \"My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated\nListen to me, I want a single bill from you\nNothin' less, nothin' more\"\nI told him I ain't have it and closed my door\nTell me; how much a dollar cost?\n\n[Chorus: James

he's starin' at me, I grab my key\nHe's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave\nAnd somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see\nThe reason why he was mad at a stranger\nLike I was supposed to save him\nLike I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor\nHe's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser\nHe's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious\n'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect\nIf I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck\nI never understood someone beggin' for goods\nAskin' for handouts, takin' it if they could\nAnd this particular person just had it down pat\nStarin' at me for the longest until he finally asked\n\"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?\nA humble man is all that we ever need\"\nTell me; how much a dollar cost?\n\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nIt's more to feed your mind\nWater, sun and love, the one you love\nAll you need, the air you

me lookin' at the universe different\nI should distance myself, I should keep it relentless\nMy selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?\nSo I'ma tell you like I told the last bum\nCrumbs and pennies, I need all of mines\nAnd I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time\nI got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind\nWhen I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend\nI smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin\nMoonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'\nI'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal\nKazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre\nThe jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus\nAnd I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy\nHe looked at me and said, \"Your potential is bittersweet\"\nI looked at him and said, \"Every nickel is mines to keep\"\nHe looked at me and said, \"Know the truth, it'll set you free\nYou're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power\nThe choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit\nThe nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost\nThe price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss\u2014I am God\"\n\n[Outro: Ronald Isley]\nI washed my hands, I said my grace\nWhat more do you want from me?\nTears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be\nShades of grey will never change if I

start questioning God, \"What is my purpose?\"\nHe said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian\nAnd this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in\nI'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met\nHopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed\nFelt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over\nWalked out the church, then got

to school, but she need some help\nBecause it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice\nThat said, \"The Devil is a lie, make a better choice\"\nAnd so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing\nWith those crazy ass people at the county building\nLooked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way\nThen got a

deserve it\nI flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel\nTo make karma come faster than she normally will\nIt's ill, to see my faith try and leave me\nIt's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy\nI'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout\nBut it never rain in California unless the pistols out\nUntil then, my feet planted on the ground\nShadowboxing my conscience till my faith

stressing whenever times is hard\nYour mind's slipping, wondering, \"Is there really a God?\"\nKnowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain\nBut whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains\nWe can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer\nCause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair\nAnd your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care\nAt the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares\nSearching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong\nJust know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room\nI watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost\nAnd wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before\nMaybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better\nBut what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever\nSo the next time you feel like your world's about to end\nI hope you studied because He's testing your faith again\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'd

name\nI made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing\nI been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac\nSo dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged\nMy father was a public figure, bigger than life\nLived as a winner, on stages alike\nRivers of people surely united, just to see our bond\nTime carried on, that was a common thread\nMy perfect father had many flaws\nStill they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison\nHe had more children, I was the oldest\nWe always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em\nHe told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings\nSexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school\nThe price of being iconic was demonic and screwed\nI stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news\nStress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused\nI knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose\nSee, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued\nThey crucified my affiliation for points to prove\nAnd now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you\nMy total existence was for makin' a smiling move\nThey said that I'll live forever\nBut the moment he died, more accusations arrived\nI had to die too\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963\nThe whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV\nMy come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief\nHow could a group of words be so great?\nDesigned to make you think\nRaces and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form\nHow gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?\nThe person responsible, my creator\nHe never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation\nWatch him perform with conviction\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen\nI gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission\nHis life became heroic, then tables turned\nMy creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned\nOther women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect\nIt made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me\nI prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy\nHow many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?\nI won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job\nI was only born to make sure your children can play outside\nAnd I imagine the other demons he hid before he died\nIf they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive\nBecause of you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI was born in paranoia, it's poison for us\nWe can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck\nThe critics formed a new coalition and huddled up\nThe non-creators are now elated and out of touch\nWhy can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?\nStop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived\nYou want the head of the messenger and the history from him\nWhich eventually takes away from the good you accustom\nThink of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'\nThe bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in\nThe great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice\nWhy can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?\nBecause your better judgement will always look down on me\nBut if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me\nI got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see\nIt goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality\nSee, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?\nIf Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?\nI can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god\nJust know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art\nSincerely yours"}, {"title": "World Negatives", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "genre": null, "lyrics": "[Intro: Ab-Soul]\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nWatch how I kill them with the funky

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\n\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\n\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Mother: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Mother: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\n\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise

I love Cara Lewis :-)\nI love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It\u2019s so challenging and fun and I\u2019m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I\u2019m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don\u2019t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I\u2019ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down\u2026to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway\u2026to having an office in LA that was shut down after the \u201cMTV\u201d moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga\nI moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men\u2019s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti\u2019s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity\nI designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I\u2019m \u201callowed\u201d to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas\u2026\nEarly 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don\u2019t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don\u2019t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn\u2019t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate\nI remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women\u2019s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don\u2019t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished \u201cCosby Show\u201d sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn\u2019t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike\u2019s in 4th grade\nBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively.

I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs\u2026DONDA\nThis will all take time but I wanted everyone\u2019s to know what I really care about\u2026I care about people\u2026I care about my fans\u2026I care about people who have never heard of me\u2026There are over 7 billion people on the planet now\u2026It\u2019s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic.

now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly I probably did it subliminally for you\nSo I could come back a brand-new me\nYou helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, believe me you\nI've been through the wringer\nBut they can do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead: no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters\nAnd raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up\n'Cause I'm raisin' the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars\nI feel amazin', and I'm\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm

by (Yeah)\nNow my community's gated and I\nMade it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)\nI'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now\nGuess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)\nBut I still remember the days of\nMinimum wage for general labor\nWelfare recipient since a minor\nLook how government assistance has made ya!\nAdversity, if at first you don't succeed\nPut your temper to more use\n'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse\nThat should only give you more fuel\nShow 'em why you're you\nSo close, God, it's like I almost got it\nBut close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes\nSo I Unabomb shit\u2014tick, tick, tick\u2014no remorse, pew!\nScrew it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick\nThat's why they call me firecracker\nI grew up on WIC\u2014wick, wick, wick\u2014with a short fuse\nI got some important news to report to\nAnyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite\nSpotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you still believe in me?\nDidn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?\nI'll never forget if you turn your back on me now\nAnd walk out, I will never let you live it down\nI'll never quit, do you still believe in me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, I know sometimes\nThese thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice\nTo me they're just ink blots\nI just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise\nSo you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)\nOr you retards can roll the dice\nBut beef will at least cost you your career\n'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced\nBut this middle finger's free as a bird\nNuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth\nToo short for the verse, studied his formula, learned\nHow to incorporate a curse\nPoint it towards corporate America\nStick a fork in and turn\n'Cause four-letter words are more better heard\nThe world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours\nBut sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it\nI was there consolin' you when no one knew it\nWhen your situation showed no improvement\nI was that door, you walked over to it\nI'm the light at the end of the tunnel\nSo people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it\nWhen that tunnel vision is unclear\nShit becomes too much to bear\nSince \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\"\nWhen I was havin' trouble with the snare\nI'm that unrealistic prayer answered\nAnd I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh\nWhen you struggle with despair\nThat double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair\nOf nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you still

always got Proof at my back\nI called you \"Proof\" because I knew for a fact\nMy ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you\n'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so\nGive me that inkling and mo\u2013\n\u2013tivation to go, Hussein with the flow\nFake fans that are two-faced didn't show\nLet heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul\nLayin' vocals two days in a row\nTrue statement, hate to go down this road\nBut there's only one route to cross this bridge\nSo I walk in this bitch with loose change\n'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll\nBut it's never too late to start a new beginnin'\nThat goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?\nUse the tools you're given!\nOr you're gon' use the cards you're dealt\nAs an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?\nI used to play the loser/victim\n'Til I saw the way Proof was driven\nI found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet\nAnd when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets\nFanny packs, hourglasses\nIf time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste\nMan, in my younger days\nThat dream was so much fun to chase\nIt's like I'd run in place\nWhile this shit dangled in front of my face\nBut how do you keep up the pace\nAnd the hunger pangs once you've won the race?\nWhen that dual exhaust is coolin' off\n'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at

you, but dang\nI never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it\nYou ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!\nThings that should've been private with me and your mother is public\nI can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it\nI'll put out this last album then I'm done with it\nOne-hundred percent finished\nFed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\nAnd if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote\nAs a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope\nI'm sliding down a slippery slope\nAnyways sweetie, I better go\nI'm getting sleepy, love, Dad\u2026 shit, I don't know\n\n[The sound of a bottle of pills being opened is

Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck\nI deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check\nI'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\nFull of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged\nAnd my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper\nI pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer\nWatchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders\nThese overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\nAlong with the small fries and average half-pinters\nBut player-haters turnin'

jobs with lame pay\nAnd I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play\n'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way\n'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan\nOr comfortable and roomy in a 6\nBut they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics\nWho walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day\nAnd yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill\nThat's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal\nThat's

rock bottom\nI've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)\nI'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em\nHoldin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em\nAnd them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em\nAnd while you flaunt 'em\nI could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em\nI got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?\n'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song\nI'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough

whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'\nWho coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?\nAnd while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these

see\nAnother rainy day without you lying next to me\n\nHigh upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy\nWith his eyes on the ground, his head is bowed\nHe's a fool and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams\nAnd he waits, but he will not see the falling of the rain\nNo, he will not see the falling of the rain\n\n[Bridge]\n\nSo now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all

would agree, they know that you're not\nI know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot\nBars sound like I'm under oath nigga\nI Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas\nEither I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga\nI'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas\nYou bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga\nI'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga\nOh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails\nAnd show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel\nThat five star in your city, they know where we at\nI hit the

Cole]\nJodeci's back\nYou bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back\nI call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none\nThe way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga\n(Fuck you mean you ain\u2019t got no condoms)\nJodeci's back\nFuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back\nI paint pictures and flip words\nNigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)\n\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nRoof top, hoes turnt up\nLookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up\nWonder where she is, fuck could she be?\nShe's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak\nHeard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak\nCount a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me\nAin't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas\nCame in this game never frontin' on you niggas\nGave you heart and soul, stories of my pain\nFelt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame\nCaught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame\n'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no\nFuck your list you lame niggas and doubters\nI'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest\nGo check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started\nI'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********\nHold your applause\nWho gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?\nDavid and Goliath, takin' on the giants\nNo need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole\nNo false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars\nTappin' into '94 Nas\nOr that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre\nWhich is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy\nToday I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours\nJust to get their dollar signed\nThoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'\nTrenchcoat flow, bottom line\nTo these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine\nFlow dumber than your projections\nThis makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet\nYour covers keep perplexin' me\nMaybe it's too complex for me\nBut is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?\n'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me\nYou legends know
