conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn\u2019t wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m no mortal man\nMaybe I\u2019m just another nigga\u201d\n\nShit and that\u2019s all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain\u2019t really a poem\nI just felt like it\u2019s something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\n\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat\u2019s how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I\u2019m saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\n\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that\u2019s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\n\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it\u2019s time to make millions for myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\n\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\n\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it\u2019s no problem, you know\nI mean, it\u2019s a problem but I\u2019m not finna let them know\nI\u2019m finna go straight through\n\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\n\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back\n\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I\u2019m fighting a war I can\u2019t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\n\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that\u2019s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it\u2019s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don\u2019t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, you can look around\nYou don\u2019t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\n\nThat\u2019s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere\u2019s nothing but turmoil goin\u2019 on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don\u2019t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it\u2019s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain\u2019t gonna be no playing\nIt\u2019s gonna be murder, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nIt\u2019s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna happen\n\nThat\u2019s crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don\u2019t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don\u2019t know what type of energy I\u2019ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it's spirits, we ain\u2019t even really rappin\u2019\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt\u2019s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac?

I\u2019m chillin' once I park this luxury car\nHopping out feeling big as Mutombo\n\"20 on pump 6,\" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo\n20 years ago, can't forget\nNow I can lend him a ear or two\nHow to stack these residuals tenfold\nThe liberal concept of what men'll do\n\"20 on 6,\" he didn't hear me\nIndigenous African only spoke Zulu\nMy American tongue was leery\nWalked out the gas station\nA homeless man with a semi-tan complexion\nAsked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land\nDeep water, powder blue skies that crack open\nA piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'\nHe begged and pleaded\nAsked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it\nTold him, \"Beat it\"\nContributin' money just for his pipe\u2014I couldn't see it\nHe said, \"My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated\nListen to me, I want a single bill from you\nNothin' less, nothin' more\"\nI told him I ain't have it and closed my door\nTell me; how much a dollar cost?\n\n[Chorus: James

he's starin' at me, I grab my key\nHe's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave\nAnd somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see\nThe reason why he was mad at a stranger\nLike I was supposed to save him\nLike I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor\nHe's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser\nHe's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious\n'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect\nIf I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck\nI never understood someone beggin' for goods\nAskin' for handouts, takin' it if they could\nAnd this particular person just had it down pat\nStarin' at me for the longest until he finally asked\n\"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?\nA humble man is all that we ever need\"\nTell me; how much a dollar cost?\n\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nIt's more to feed your mind\nWater, sun and love, the one you love\nAll you need, the air you

me lookin' at the universe different\nI should distance myself, I should keep it relentless\nMy selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?\nSo I'ma tell you like I told the last bum\nCrumbs and pennies, I need all of mines\nAnd I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time\nI got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind\nWhen I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend\nI smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin\nMoonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'\nI'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal\nKazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre\nThe jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus\nAnd I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy\nHe looked at me and said, \"Your potential is bittersweet\"\nI looked at him and said, \"Every nickel is mines to keep\"\nHe looked at me and said, \"Know the truth, it'll set you free\nYou're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power\nThe choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit\nThe nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost\nThe price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss\u2014I am God\"\n\n[Outro: Ronald Isley]\nI washed my hands, I said my grace\nWhat more do you want from me?\nTears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be\nShades of grey will never change if I

start questioning God, \"What is my purpose?\"\nHe said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian\nAnd this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in\nI'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met\nHopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed\nFelt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over\nWalked out the church, then got

to school, but she need some help\nBecause it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice\nThat said, \"The Devil is a lie, make a better choice\"\nAnd so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing\nWith those crazy ass people at the county building\nLooked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way\nThen got a

deserve it\nI flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel\nTo make karma come faster than she normally will\nIt's ill, to see my faith try and leave me\nIt's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy\nI'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout\nBut it never rain in California unless the pistols out\nUntil then, my feet planted on the ground\nShadowboxing my conscience till my faith

stressing whenever times is hard\nYour mind's slipping, wondering, \"Is there really a God?\"\nKnowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain\nBut whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains\nWe can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer\nCause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair\nAnd your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care\nAt the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares\nSearching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong\nJust know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room\nI watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost\nAnd wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before\nMaybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better\nBut what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever\nSo the next time you feel like your world's about to end\nI hope you studied because He's testing your faith again\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'd

name\nI made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing\nI been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac\nSo dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged\nMy father was a public figure, bigger than life\nLived as a winner, on stages alike\nRivers of people surely united, just to see our bond\nTime carried on, that was a common thread\nMy perfect father had many flaws\nStill they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison\nHe had more children, I was the oldest\nWe always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em\nHe told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings\nSexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school\nThe price of being iconic was demonic and screwed\nI stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news\nStress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused\nI knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose\nSee, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued\nThey crucified my affiliation for points to prove\nAnd now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you\nMy total existence was for makin' a smiling move\nThey said that I'll live forever\nBut the moment he died, more accusations arrived\nI had to die too\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963\nThe whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV\nMy come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief\nHow could a group of words be so great?\nDesigned to make you think\nRaces and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form\nHow gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?\nThe person responsible, my creator\nHe never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation\nWatch him perform with conviction\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen\nI gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission\nHis life became heroic, then tables turned\nMy creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned\nOther women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect\nIt made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me\nI prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy\nHow many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?\nI won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job\nI was only born to make sure your children can play outside\nAnd I imagine the other demons he hid before he died\nIf they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive\nBecause of you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI was born in paranoia, it's poison for us\nWe can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck\nThe critics formed a new coalition and huddled up\nThe non-creators are now elated and out of touch\nWhy can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?\nStop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived\nYou want the head of the messenger and the history from him\nWhich eventually takes away from the good you accustom\nThink of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'\nThe bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in\nThe great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice\nWhy can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?\nBecause your better judgement will always look down on me\nBut if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me\nI got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see\nIt goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality\nSee, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?\nIf Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?\nI can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god\nJust know the Earth is just a rock without the

We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\n\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his \"little bro\"\u2014a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\n\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. \"It all happened when I was overseas,\" he says. \"I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.\"\n\nIt's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds\u2014one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever\u2014and since then his legend has spread fast.\n\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album\u2014about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing \"that crazy-ass girl Sherane\"\u2014is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest\u2014the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house\u2014and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast\u2014Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness\u2014but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song \"Control\"\u2014a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself \"the king of New York,\" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\n\n\"Control\" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\n\nKendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it \"back to the set\" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. \"It can be complicated and confusing,\" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. \"From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous\u2014I still live in this world.\" And when someone back home needs something, \"I still gotta get that phone call.\"\n\nIt's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\n\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: \"When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow.\" Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: \"Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.\"\n\n\nOn the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over \"Control\" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on \"Control,\" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of \"Hold On, We're Going Home,\" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. \"You watch,\" he joked, \"I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!\"\n\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. \"Pretty cool.\" Shrugs. \"And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.\"\n\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the \"Control\" thing: \"You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'\u2014pretending like nothing ever happened.\" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped \"Control\" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\n\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out\u2014\"Control\" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. \"Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,\" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, \"No\u2014peer. If anything. We all peers.\"\n\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\n\n\"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now\u2014it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette.\"\n\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. \"It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin',\" he explains. \"I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle.\"\n\nMuch of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos\u2014some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton\u2014and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. \"When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets\u2014nobody never really knows,\" he says. \"But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.\"\n\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, \"Aw, man, I can't go to no club.\"\n\nKendrick spoke up.\n\n\"We have to go.\"\n\n\"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go.\"\n\n\"You know me,\" Kendrick explained. \"I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. \"You guys seem so calm,\" I said.\n\n\"Well,\" Tiffith told me, \"we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.\"\nThe gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati\u2014Jay, Bey\u2014mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the \"King of New York\" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. \"It was all love at that party,\" he told me on the private jet.\n\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: \"We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.\"\n\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency\u2014Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK\u2014a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\n\nIt's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be.\"\n\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, \"I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous\". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising."}, {"title": "Kurupted", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "genre": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThese streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic\nAstronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb\nPull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip\nIt's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent\nThis is Jesus of Nazareth\nSpittin' gold policies to a world unknown\nIn a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds\nPrestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed\nCan corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick\nScreaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower\nI dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder\nNo challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental\nHazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein\nI'm kurupted!\n\nI'm kurupted!\n\n[Verse 2]\nGimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees\nVerbically useless, oh you got the Juice?

I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.\n\n[As RINGO walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the floor playing with a cat.]\n\nBOBBY:\nPuss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...\nRINGO:\nWould you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?\nBOBBY:\nNo, I would not.\nRINGO:\nOh yeah, I didn't think you would.\n\n[Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house where he lives with the other Beatles.]\n\nRINGO:\nI could have sworn there was a yellow submarine.

No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.\n\n[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard.

King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]\n\nJOHN:\nDo you think we're interrupting something?\nRINGO:\nI think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?\n\n[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]\n\nGEORGE:\nIt's all in the mind.\nJOHN:\nTry one of those doors.\n\n[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]\n\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do look very nice, don't they?\nRINGO:\nYes, they do.\nJOHN:\nThey do, though, don't they?\nGEORGE:\nYes, they do.\nRINGO:\nDon't dey, dough?\nGEORGE:\nDough?\n\n[PAUL meets them.]\n\nJOHN:\nDon't ask.

How do you start this thing?\nFRED:\nIt starts with a Blue Meanie attack.\nJOHN:\nSupposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?\nFRED:\nThen you start looking for a switch.\nRINGO:\nPerhaps this is it.\n\n[The submarine sails into a strange world.]\n\n[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]\nOne, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?\nFive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you\nA, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?\nE, F, G, H, I, J / I love you\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\nBlack, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?\nPink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)\nAll together now (all together now),\nall together now (all together now)...\nSail the ship\nChop the tree\nSkip the rope\nLook at me\nAll together now\nAll together now (all together now)\u2026\n\n[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]\n\nRINGO:\nWhat time is it?\nJOHN:\nIt's time to time.\nPAUL:\nLook, the hands are slowing down.\n\n[The submarine sails backwards.]\n\nPAUL:\nDo you ever get the feeling...\nJOHN:\nYeah.\nPAUL:\n\u2026 that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?\nRINGO:\nWhat's happening, John?\nJOHN:\nWell, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.\nGEORGE:\nAll right.\nJOHN:\nRelatively speaking, that is.\nGEORGE:\nOf course. Maybe time's gone on strike.\nRINGO:\nWhat for?\nGEORGE:\nShorter hours.\nRINGO:\nI don't blame it.

It's speeding up now.\nPAUL [looking outside]:\nFunny... a submarine remarkably like our own.\nJOHN:\nUncannily.\nRINGO:\nThere's someone in it. Look.\nJOHN:\nAnd they're waving.\nRINGO:\nIt's a group of fellas.\nJOHN:\nWave back.
